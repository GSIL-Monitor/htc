        <h4><strong>Media Gallery: How it works</strong></h4>
    <p>
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The primary function of the Media Gallery is to view your uploaded media, both Photos and Video
        clips. It also provides the means to perform Administrative functions.
    </p>

    <h4>
    <i class="fa fa-image"></i> <strong>Viewing Media</strong>
    </h4>

    <p>
    Initially the gallery is presented as a page grid of thumbnails, each representing either a photo or a video clip sent to the portal by your camera.
    As your camera continues capturing and sending to the server, you can accumulate several pages of thumbnails. To make it easier for you to view
    on your device, whether it be a desktop computer, tablet or mobile phone, there are two buttons of interest:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Layout</li>
        <li>Thumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>The <label class="label label-primary"> Layout</label> button provides a way to customize the number of grid columns that you prefer.  Click the button and select a layout option.
    The thumbnails will auto resize to fit the width, meaning more columns will produce smaller thumbnails and fewer, larger ones.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The <label class="label label-primary"> Thumbs</label> button provides a way to control the number of thumbnails sent per page by the server.  This is important for several reasons.
    Fewer thumbs per page will load faster and use less data (if you use a mobile plan for example).  However you may find it more convenient to see more on a
    page possibly giving you a full day overview  of your activity.
    </p>
    <p><strong><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>Both the Layout and Thumbs options will be remembered per camera in the system and will have these same values the next time you log in.</strong></p><br />

    <h5><strong><i class="fa fa-play-circle"></i> The Lightbox</strong></h5>
    <p>
    In order to begin to view your media in a larger format simply click one of the thumbnails in the grid.  This will open a "lightbox".  A lightbox is a viewer that is optimized to
    help you scroll through the media files, in either direction.  To move back and forth you can click the left and right arrows, tap left or right arrow keys on a keyboard, or if
    your device has a touch screen you can swipe left or right.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to exit the lightbox mode, press ESC on a keyboard, click or tap the <strong><i class="fa fa-times"></i></strong> in the upper right corner to close.  Clicking or
    tapping outside the boundry of an image will also close the lightbox viewer.
    </p>

    <h4>
        <i class="fa fa-wrench"></i>  Manage Media
    </h4>
    <p>
        The <label class="label label-primary"><i class="fa fa-wrench"></i>  Manage</label> button toggles the management mode and reveals several additional related buttons.  These are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><label class="label label-primary"> Select None</label></li>
        <li><label class="label label-primary"> Select All</label></li>
        <li><label class="label label-primary"> With Selected</label></li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <p>
        Toggling or activating the Manage mode will add a checkbox to each thumbnail in the grid, allowing you to select individual thumbs on the page.
        Once you have selected one or more thumbs by checking the box(es), you have several options. Use the <label class="label label-primary"> With Selected</label> button
        to perform the following with your selected media:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><label class="label label-primary"> Delete</label></li>
        <li><label class="label label-primary"> Request HighRes MAX</label></li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
        <strong>Delete</strong> will remove this media file from the server permanently.</p>
    <p>
    <strong>Request HighRes MAX</strong> will queue an action request for each selected thumnail that is a photo event.  When the camera next communicates with
    the server, it will be instructed one by one to process these requests. Once you have performed this action select the <strong>Action History</strong> tab
    and the pending requests should be listed.<br />
    </p>

    <h5><strong><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>Why do I want HighRes MAX?</strong></h5>
    <p>The purpose of this function is to request from the camera a larger size than was originally uploaded.  HighRes MAX is the largest Photo upload size supported.
    It is good practice to run the camera in a lower resolution like Standard Low or Standard Medium to achieve better battery life and reduce Image Points consumption.
    Keep in mind that you can always request a HighRes MAX copy of any thumbnail which you require more detail. Requesting a HighRes Max will consume additional Image Points
    in your data plan.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <strong><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>If while selecting thumbs, if you select both Video and Photo targets, and Photos that are already HighRes MAX on the server
        this will not create any issues as these items will just be skipped in the process.</strong>
