        <div id="tier-info" class="panel-collapse collapse">
            <div class="panel-body">
                <span class="help-block"> Each tier indicates the <span style="color:white">cost</span> and the <span style="color:white">duration</span> in months.  The price is for the entire period.<br /><br />
                <span style="color:white"><strong>Example: If you select a 3 Month tier under SILVER, you are paying for all 3 months. The total points awarded upfront will be 15,000.  You camera can utilize these points at any rate during the 3 month period.</strong></span><br/> <br />

                To the right of each tier pricing is a <span style="color:white">Cost Per Point</span> amount.  The cpp tells you what it costs you per point as your camera uploads media
                files to the portal.<!--  Of course, the lower the cpp then the cheaper it is to operate your camera at that tier. Please make a note of the points cost per upload on this page
                to better understand your points requirements.--><br /><br />
                <strong>Unused Points are not carried over into future periods.</strong>
