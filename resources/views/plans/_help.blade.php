<span class="help-block"> Each tier indicates the <span style="color:white">cost</span> and the <span style="color:white">duration</span> in months.  The price is for the entire period.<br /><br />

    <span style="color:white"><strong>Example: If you select a 3 Month tier under SILVER, you are paying for all 3 months. The total points awarded upfront will be 15,000.  You camera can utilize these points at any rate during the 63month period.</strong></span><br/> <br />

    To the right of each tier pricing is a <span style="color:white">Cost Per Point</span> amount.  The cpp tells you what it costs you per point as your camera uploads media
    files to the portal.  Of course, the lower the cpp then the cheaper it is to operate your camera at that tier. Please make a note of the points cost per upload on this page
    to better understand your points requirements.<br /><br />
    <strong>Unused Points are not carried over into future periods.</strong>
